        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rich, creamy pasta dish that comes together in 15 minutes!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (10 oz.) package fettuccine pasta noodles</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced </li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add fettuccine noodles and salt and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm) according to package directions, about 2-3 minutes for fresh fettuccine noodles and 8-10 minutes for dried noodles. Reserve ½ cup pasta water and then drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt butter over medium high heat for 1 minute. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add heavy cream and Parmesan cheese. Stir well and bring the sauce to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and keep stirring until thickened to a desired consistency, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in cooked fettuccine and toss well to combine. If you like it a bit saucier, slowly add ¼ cup to ½ cup reserved pasta water and stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle extra Parmesan and freshly ground black pepper on top.</li>
        </ol>
