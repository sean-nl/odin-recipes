        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (15 oz.) can crushed tomatoes (2 cups)</li>
            <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>3-4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Meatballs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>¾ cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine beef with breadcrumbs, milk, egg, garlic, parsley, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Mix well and form the mixture into a uniform consistency. Take 2 spoonfuls of the beef mixture at a time and roll them into meatballs. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet or shallow saucepan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes until the hot oil sizzles. Slowly add the meatballs and gently stir to cook until browned on all sides, about 6 to 8 minutes. Make sure to stir gently to prevent meatballs from disintegrating. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and set aside (Note that the meatballs are not fully cooked at this point).</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add onion and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and bay leaves, and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Return the meatballs to the skillet and bring the sauce mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cover the lid and let it simmer for 8-10 minutes until the meatballs are fully cooked.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with extra Parmesan if desired and serve immediately over pasta, rice, or mashed potatoes.</li>
        </ol>
